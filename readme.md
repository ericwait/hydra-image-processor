Hydra Image Processor (HIP)
===

Hydra Image Processor is a hardware accelerated signal processing library written with [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone). HIP aims to create a signal processing library that can be incorporated into many software tools. This library is licensed under BSD 3-Clause to encourage use in open-source and commercial software. My only plea is that if you find bugs or make changes that you contribute them back to this repository. Happy processing and enjoy!
